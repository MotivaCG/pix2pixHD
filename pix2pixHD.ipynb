        "1. **Same order:** The images in your train_A folder should be in the same order as the images in your train_B folder. They are fed into pix2pixHD in alphatbetical/numerical order. Your images should automatically be in the same order, but keep this in mind just in case you notice mismatches in your results.\n",
        "1. **Consistent image dimensions** of all your input images should have the same dimensions, and all your output images should have the same dimensions.\n",
        "1. **Consistent input/output dimensions:** Technically, pix2pixHD can train datasets where the input dimensions are different from the output (like if you were training an image upscaler), but for most situations, your input and output dimensions should match.\n",
        "1. **Dataset size:** Depending on your goals, and the type of data you're working with, the amount of images you need for a \"successful\" model will vary. Some general tips: I would aim for **_500 image pairs minimum, but more is better. Shoot for the 2,000-5,000 image pair range)._** For example, if your dataset has 1,000 images, that means it has 2x 1,000 images -- 1,000 input images (train_A), and 1,000 output images (train_B).\n",
        "1. **Efficient dataset management:** Uploading and downloading thousands of images using Google Drive can be painfully slow. I recommend downloading and installing [Google Backup and Sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) (Google Drive's desktop application for automatic file syncing). If you set it up, I recommend only syncing the specific dataset folders in your Google Drive that you want to work with, otherwise you might end up downloading too much to your computer. Also, during the first step of the setup process, make sure to click 'Sign in with your browser.'"
